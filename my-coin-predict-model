üîù Ultimate 10-Step ML Blueprint (Numbered & Simplified)
Define Objective & Metrics

Specify prediction goal (e.g., "BTC price 24h ahead")

Choose metrics (MAE/RMSE for regression, Accuracy/F1 for classification)

Acquire & Audit Data

Identify sources (APIs, databases, CSVs)

Check data quality (missing values, time ranges)

Clean & Structure Data

Handle missing data (drop/impute)

Standardize formats (dates, currencies)

Exploratory Analysis (EDA)

Visualize trends (price movements)

Identify correlations (price vs. volume)

Feature Engineering

Create time-based features (moving averages)

Select top 5-10 most predictive features

Data Splitting

70% train / 15% validation / 15% test

Preserve time order for financial data

Model Selection & Training

Start simple (Linear Regression)

Progress to complex (XGBoost/LSTM if needed)

Validation & Testing

Validate on unseen data (prevent overfitting)

Compare metrics across models

Hyperparameter Optimization

Tune 2-3 most critical parameters

Use cross-validation

Deployment Prep (Optional)

Document model limitations

Plan monitoring (data drift checks)
